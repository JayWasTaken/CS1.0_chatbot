Weather Playlist Reccomendation Bot

This chatbot is one i thought would make in order to reccomend some music based on the weather. 

The bot has a list of several different kinds of weather with a sub-section saying what keywords will work when the user types in a response.

When the program is run, it will display what it does in a short summary. Then, within a while loop, the bot will ask the user what the weather is. Then will repeat the question, output user response, and reccomendation for that response until the user types 'done' which will end the loop and stop running the program.
